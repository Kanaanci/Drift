# Drift
Drift is a program developed for a Kent State University student for an art project. This program will take a screenshot at random intervals of time ranging from 5 seconds to 18,000 seconds (5 hours).
These screenshots are then stored in a newly created folder on the desktop, named "Drift Captures".

The motivation behind this app:
"The app itself would be an artwork. Conceptually Iâ€™m interested in Guy Debord and his ideas psychogeography. 
He made this collage called The Naked City which is a collage of maps of Paris to communicate a mental wandering of the city which is seemingly random but reflects a large amount of unknown factors which I relate to the idea of Determinism. 
So, Pretty much, I am thinking of the screenshots as a living map of the user, seemingly random with an invisible structure to them. It would be a reflection of the users digital psychogeography."
